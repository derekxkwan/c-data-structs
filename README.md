implementation of data strctures in C (under work):

BEFORE BUILDING ANYTHING: make an obj directory in root of project

currently has:
singly linked list and functions: slist.h header file
 - to make, type "make slist" and test with "./slisttest"<br/>

doubly linked list and functions: dlist.h header file
 - to make, type "make dlist" and test with "./dlisttest"<br/>

min/max heaps (heap type 0 = min, heap type 1 = max): heap.h header file
 - to make, type "make heap" and test with "./heaptest"
